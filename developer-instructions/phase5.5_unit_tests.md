- Write unit tests for **ALL PRD Must-Have** features using 
    - **Vitest**, 
    - **@testing-library/react**, 
    - **@testing-library/user-event**, 
    - **@testing-library/jest-dom**.
- Aim for **1 happy-path test per Must-Have** (basic render + one user action + assertion). Keep tests short and stable.
- Each test MUST include meaningful **assertions** using `jest-dom` matchers (e.g. `toBeInTheDocument`, `toHaveTextContent`, `toBeChecked`).
- Place tests in `src/tests/` as `*.test.ts(x)`; keep tests deterministic (no real network or external services).
- Test **user-visible behavior only** (query by role/label/text; avoid implementation details).
- EXECUTE from `codebase/`:
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run build`
- Fix failures and re-run until BOTH commands pass.
- Create/update at **PROJECT ROOT**:
  - `TESTING.md` (how to run tests + PRD Must-Have coverage)
  - `UNIT-TEST-REPORT.md` (pass/fail summary + tested features)
- Do NOT proceed to the next phase until all above conditions are satisfied.
