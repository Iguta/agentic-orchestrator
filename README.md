We'll use Cursor agent to write react code and playwright test cases....we'll take advantage of Cursor MCP. 
And then we'll have Langraph ochestrate the workflow for a deterministic output. 

We'll have  a developer, code reviewer, code debugging and fixing errors, software test engineer, and solutions devops to deploy the solution.
